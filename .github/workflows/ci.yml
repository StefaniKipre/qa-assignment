# This workflow name will appear in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.
name: Cypress CI

# This section defines when the workflow will run.
on:
  # The workflow is triggered on every push to the 'main' branch.
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  
  # The workflow is also triggered on a schedule (e.g., every day at 12:00 AM UTC).
  # This is useful for nightly runs to ensure everything is working even if there are no code changes.
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # At 00:00 UTC every day.

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that run in parallel.
jobs:
  # This job will build the project and run the Cypress tests.
  build-and-test:
    # We specify the runner environment. Ubuntu is a common and reliable choice.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # The steps a job should follow.
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code.
      # This action checks out your repository at the specific commit that triggered the workflow.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the Node.js environment.
      # This action installs Node.js on the runner, which is required to run Cypress.
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18' # We'll use Node.js version 18.

      # Step 3: Install dependencies.
      # 'npm ci' is a more reliable way to install dependencies in a CI environment than 'npm install'.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run Cypress tests.
      # This is the main step that executes your Cypress test suite.
      # The Cypress action handles the details of installing Cypress and running the tests.
      - name: Run Cypress tests
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v6
        with:
          # This specifies the command to run your Cypress tests.
          command: npm run cypress:run
